WebRTC Toggle button for Firefox
========================

WebRTC allows websites to get your actual IP address from behind your VPN.  

This addon allows you to toggle WebRTC off and on at the browser level by one-click button.

## Privacy Policy

This addon collects nothing and sends nothing.

### Note
Some audio/video conferencing web services like Google Meet or Microsoft Teams depend on WebRTC to work. Firefox can't disable WebRTC per-tab or per-window, the setting affects the entire browser. That's why it is a toggler - toggle it on and off to get flexible security solution.
